<h1 align="center">SECOND CHOICE WEB</h1>

[View the live webpage here](https://second-chance-web.herokuapp.com/)
<p>
    Our generation is facing a major global concern: adapting our current lifestyle to achieve a better environment sustainability.
</p>
<p>
    The scope of the website is giving good products a “second chance” (as the title suggests) in order to be reused by other people. 
</p>
<p>
    The website I created is a second-hand products web-shop where users can sale things they don’t need but still in good functional condition. 
</p>
<p>
    The purpose of the buyer visitors is to find good products at affordable prices which otherwise would be too expensive or temporary necessary.
    Like people relocating for a short-term and they need some furniture or people who wouldn’t spend a lot of money on new bikes for the children
    and they rather buy second hand until kids grow old enough to use the same size for longer time.
</p>
<p>
    The purpose of the seller visitors is to be able to get some money out of the products which don’t serve their needs anymore.
</p>
<p>
    My personal purpose as a developer in creating Second Chance website is learning how to design, develop and implement a back-end for a web
    application using Python and Flask micro-framework into MongoDB database.
</p>
<p>
    The creation of this website is subject solely to educational purposes.

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

## Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
