<h1 align="center">SECOND CHOICE WEB</h1>

[View the live webpage here](https://second-chance-web.herokuapp.com/)
--

Our generation is facing a major global concern: adapting our current lifestyle to achieve a better environment sustainability.


The scope of the website is giving good products a “second chance” (as the title suggests) in order to be reused by other people. 


The website I created is a second-hand products web-shop where users can sale things they don’t need but still in good functional condition. 


The purpose of the buyer visitors is to find good products at affordable prices which otherwise would be too expensive or temporary necessary.
Like people relocating for a short-term and they need some furniture or people who wouldn’t spend a lot of money on new bikes for the children
and they rather buy second hand until kids grow old enough to use the same size for longer time.


The purpose of the seller visitors is to be able to get some money out of the products which don’t serve their needs anymore.


My personal purpose as a developer in creating Second Chance website is learning how to design, develop and implement a back-end for a web
application using Python and Flask micro-framework into MongoDB database.


The creation of this website is subject solely to educational purposes.

## Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

## Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
